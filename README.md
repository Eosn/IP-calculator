# IP-calculator
## Overall explanation
This code requests the user to enter an IP address and a subnet mask, both in decimal number, returning both of them in addition to the subnet and the broadcast addresses, everything in both decimal and binary numbers. This way, the following example is possible:

```
Digite o IP: 192.168.0.2
Digite a máscara de subrede: 255.255.255.89

IP: 192.168.0.2
Binário: 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000010
Máscara: 255.255.255.89
Binário: 11111111.11111111.11111111.01011001
Subrede: 192.168.0.0
Binário: 11000000.10101000.00000000.10100110
```

Besides each line of code, there's the explanation in Brazilian Portuguese of the logic used and what is being done on each function.
